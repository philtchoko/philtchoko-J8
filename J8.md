    Functional requirements relate to the "engine" of the program. These requirements allow the project to perform its goal. For example, software that allow a user to get the square root of any number have functional requirements that help the software perform this. On the other hand, non-functional requirements are more focused on factors like user friendliness or the stability of the program, maximizing the "engine's" chances of performing its goal.

    Software engineering has evolved to embrace agile development models as it isn't always possible to have all the requirements of an application to be fleshed out at once. Thus, agile development allows engineers to perform "mini" waterfall development models for specific parts of a project and gain user feedback as they continue their development of the project.
